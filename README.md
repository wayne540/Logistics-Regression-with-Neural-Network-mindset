# Logistics-Regression-with-Neural-Network-mindset
Before diving “deep” into Neural Network, it is essential to get a good intuition. What better way than to understand the logic of how the Logistic Regression Algorithm can be modeled as a simple Neural Network that actually learns from data.
The classic application of Logistics regression is binary classification. Logistic regression is useful if we are working with a dataset where the classes are more or less “linearly separable.” Neural networks are somewhat related to logistic regression. Basically, we can think of logistic regression as a one-layer neural network.
